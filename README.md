# Instacheck

**Instaparse meets test.check: property-based testing with inputs defined as EBNF grammars**

## Prerequisites:

* Build/install patched instaparse that retains comment data and does
  grammar traversal logging:

```
git clone git@github.com:kanaka/instaparse.git
cd instaparse
lein install
```

* Build and install patched test.check that fixes the frequency
  generator to shrink towards to the more common choices instead of to
  those listed first:
```
git clone git@github.com:kanaka/test.check.git
cd test.check
git checkout frequency_fix
lein install
```


## Commandline Usage

All the following example use the `test/bc.ebnf` EBNF grammar file
which specifies a simple EBNF for generating commands that can be run
with the bc (arbitrary precission calculator) program.

Generate Clojure generators (one generator per EBNF rule named after
the non-terminal):

```
lein run clj test/bc.ebnf --namespace bc.test
```

Generate a single Clojure generator (one generator named `gen-gc`):

```
lein run clj test/bc.ebnf --namespace bc.test --function gen-bc
```

Generate 10 and then 100 samples:

```
lein run samples test/bc.ebnf tmp/samp%.bc
lein run samples test/bc.ebnf --samples 100 tmp/samp%.bc
```

Output the full set of weights to a file, modify the weights file and
then generate 10 samples using the modified weights file:

```
rm tmp/samp*
lein run samples test/bc.ebnf --weights-output tmp/bc-weights.edn tmp/samp%.bc
    # tweak 0 and 1 lower (10), +,- to 1000, *,/ to 2000
lein run samples test/bc.ebnf --weights tmp/bc-weights.edn tmp/samp%.bc
```

Run the test program using test samples, then update the weights file
to increase the likelihood of 0 numbers (and thus a failure due to
divide by zero):

```
rm tmp/samp*
lein run check test/bc.ebnf --weights tmp/bc-weights.edn --sample-dir tmp/ -- test/testbc.sh -q %
    # tweak 0 to increase frequency
lein run check test/bc.ebnf --weights tmp/bc-weights.edn --sample-dir tmp/ -- test/testbc.sh -q %
```
