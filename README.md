# Instacheck 0.6.2

*Instaparse meets test.check: property-based testing with inputs defined as EBNF grammars*

If the test inputs for your program are defined by `input.ebnf` then
you can use property-base testing to test your program like this:

```
lein run check input.ebnf sample-dir/ -- ./prog %
```

This will run `./prog` with larger and larger sample files (stored in
`sample-dir`) until the program fails. Then it will run `./prog` with
smaller and smaller versions of the failure case until it finds the
smallest version that still fails.

## Library / REPL Usage

Add the following to your Clojure dependencies:

```clojure
[kanaka/instacheck "0.6.2"]
```

Here is an example of using instacheck with instaparse and test.check:

```clojure
(require '[instacheck.core :as instacheck])
(require '[instaparse.core :as instaparse])
(require '[clojure.test.check :as tc])
(require '[clojure.test.check.generators :as tc-gen])
(require '[clojure.test.check.properties :as tc-prop])

;; parser is a regular instaparse parser
(def parser (instaparse/parser "root = ('foo' #'[0-9]' ) 'bar' *"))

;; gen is a regular test.check generator based on the parser
(def gen (instacheck/ebnf->gen {} parser))

;; Generate some samples
(tc-gen/sample gen)

;; A test.check input property with gen
(def prop (tc-prop/for-all* [gen] #(< (count %) 5)))
;; Run quick-check for 10 iterations on prop
(tc/quick-check 10 prop)
```

Here is an example of using some convenience functions provided by
instacheck that encapsulate instaparse and test.check functionality:

```clojure
(require '[instacheck.core :refer [ebnf->gen run-check]])

(defn checkit [grammar opts]
  (let [gen (ebnf->gen {} grammar)
        check-fn #(do (prn :sample %) (< (count %) 5))
        report-fn #(prn :report %)]
    (run-check opts gen check-fn report-fn)))

(checkit "root = ('foo' #'[0-9]' ) 'bar' *" {:iterations 5})
```


## Commandline Usage

All the following example use the `test/bc.ebnf` EBNF grammar file
which specifies a simple EBNF for generating commands that can be run
with the bc (arbitrary precission calculator) program.

Generate Clojure generators (one generator per EBNF rule named after
the non-terminal):

```bash
lein run clj test/bc.ebnf bc.test
```

Generate a single Clojure generator (one generator named `gen-gc`):

```bash
lein run clj test/bc.ebnf bc.test --function gen-bc
```

Generate 10 and then 100 samples:

```bash
lein run samples test/bc.ebnf tmp/
lein run samples test/bc.ebnf --samples 100 tmp/
```

Output the full set of weights to a file, modify the weights file and
then generate 10 samples using the modified weights file:

```bash
rm tmp/samp*
lein run samples test/bc.ebnf --weights-output tmp/bc-weights.edn tmp/
    # change the weight for 7 (:nz-digit :alt 6) to 1000
lein run samples test/bc.ebnf --weights tmp/bc-weights.edn tmp/
```

Generate test samples and run test program using the test samples.
When a failure is found then continue testing until a more minimal
test sample is found. Then manually update the weights file to
increase the likelihood of 0 numbers (and thus a failure due to divide
by zero) and then run the tests again:

```bash
rm tmp/samp*
lein run check test/bc.ebnf --weights tmp/bc-weights.edn tmp/ -- test/testbc.sh -q %
    # tweak 0 to increase frequency
lein run check test/bc.ebnf --weights tmp/bc-weights.edn tmp/ -- test/testbc.sh -q %
```
